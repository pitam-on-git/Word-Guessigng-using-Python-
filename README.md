# Word Guessing Game ðŸŽ®

A simple and fun Python Word Guessing Game inspired by Hangman!  
The program randomly selects a word from a word bank, and you get 10 attempts to guess it letter by letter. Correct guesses reveal the hidden letters, wrong guesses reduce your attempts. Can you solve the word before you run out of tries?
